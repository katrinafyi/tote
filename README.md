# *tote* &mdash; a note taker

_tote_ is an ultra-minimal note taker. 
it's like twitter but backed by a single text file stored in any supported protocol.

the deisgn will focus on modularity and configurability. 
synchronisation will be to a server the user specifies and configuration passed through query parameters.
configuration can be imported to/from faux faux username + password fields to enable autofill by password managers.
